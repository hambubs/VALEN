  # valentines day

  This is a code bundle for valentines day. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/zgyGjEdu3ajd3kzvNIljzV/valentines-day.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
  
  ## Preview side-by-side

  Quick ways to preview while editing:

  - Open `preview.html` (project root) and split the editor so code is on the left and the preview is on the right. The file contains an iframe pointing to `http://localhost:3000/`.
  - Use the VS Code Task `Start Vite Dev Server` (see `.vscode/tasks.json`) to start the dev server from the editor.
  - Recommended extensions: see `.vscode/extensions.json` for `ms-vscode.live-server`, `ms-vscode.live-preview`, or `auchenberg.vscode-browser-preview` if you prefer an inside-editor browser.

  Commands you can run in the `valentines day` folder:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  If you want to preview on another device, run the dev server with `--host`:
  ```bash
  npm run dev -- --host
  ```

  Enjoy — open `preview.html` and the app will render inside the editor so you can work side-by-side.
